## How to Implement on Your Own Machine

Follow these steps to build and run this project yourself:

1. **Set Up the Project**  
   Use Spring Initializr or your preferred method to generate a Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies: Web, Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.

2. **Database Setup**  
   Install and run MySQL locally or start a MySQL container via Docker. Create a database for the app.

3. **Configure the Application**  
   Update the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) with your MySQL connection details and JPA settings.

4. **Define the Data Model**  
   Create the Note entity class with fields such as id, title, content, and timestamp.

5. **Create Repository Interface**  
   Implement a repository to interact with the database, including a custom method to fetch a random note.

6. **Implement Service Layer**  
   Add business logic to handle notes, including adding, fetching all, fetching by ID, and fetching random notes.

7. **Build the Controller**  
   Create REST endpoints for clients to interact with notes via HTTP requests (GET all, GET by ID, POST new notes, GET random note).

8. **Add Frontend (Optional)**  
   Place your frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) in the `static` folder of the Spring Boot project to serve them automatically.

9. **Run and Test**  
   Start the Spring Boot app and test the endpoints using Postman or your frontend. Confirm data persists and can be retrieved.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding user authentication and authorization  
- Implement update and delete operations for notes  
- Create a richer frontend with frameworks like React or Angular  
- Adding pagination and search features  
- Deploying the app on cloud platforms for public access
